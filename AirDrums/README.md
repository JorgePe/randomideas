These are the scripts used on the tutorial video:
- 'airdrum-move.py' is a Pybricks script that runs on each Move Hub
- 'airdrum-demo.py' is the first python script used as demo
- 'airdrum.py' is the full python video and uses 2x Move Hubs

You need to flash Pybricks firwmare on your Move Hubs. See 'https://pybricks.com'
You will also need a linux computer with python and 'pybricksdev' installed as a library. See 'https://github.com/pybricks/pybricksdev'.
And finally you will need to install 3 linux programs:
- xdotool
- VMPK
- Hydrogen

Yes, linux. Yes, geeky. But you want your LEGO to do nice things like playing virtual MIDI Air Drums right? So you need to embrace The Force.
